### Types of Generative AI Models
| Model Type | Description | Example Use Case |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) | Two networks competing to generate realistic data | Image synthesis, Deepfakes |
| VAEs (Variational Autoencoders) | Probabilistic models for data encoding/decoding | Image reconstruction, anomaly detection |
| Diffusion Models | Iteratively denoise random data to produce outputs | Text-to-image generation, Stable Diffusion |

```python
# Simplified self-attention mechanism in Python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def self_attention(Q, K, V):
    scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1)) / torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(K.size(-1), dtype=torch.float32))
    attention_weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
    return torch.matmul(attention_weights, V)
